# API Backend Coding Task

This is the technical test project for API oriented backends.

## Technical requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Build

```bash
make build
```

This command executes the Docker image building process and performs the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependencies installation.

---

Type `make help` for more tasks present in `Makefile`.

## Functional requirements

**Implement a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) API.**

The following add-ons will be positively evaluated:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Cache
- Documentation

---

A light infrastructure is provided with a populated MySQL database with example data and a web server using PHP built-in development server.

## Non functional requirements

- The presence of unit, integration and acceptance tests will positively appreciated.
- Use whatever you want to achieve this: MVC, hexagonal arquitecture, DDD, etc.
- A deep knowledge about SOLID, YAGNI or KISS would be positively evaluated.
- DevOps knowledge (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.) would be appreciated too.
- It's important to find a balance between code quality and deadline; releasing a non functional application in time or a perfect application out of time may be negatively evaluated.
- Good and well-documented commits will be appreciated.
- Efficient and smart use of third party libraries will be positively appreciated.

Beyond the requirements of this test we want to see what you can do, feel free to show us your real potential and, the
most important part, have fun!
